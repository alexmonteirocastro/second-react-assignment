# Second ReactJs Assignment

In this exercise I have built an appplication that:
* Takes a text input
* Outputs the length of the inputted string
* Validates if the inputted string is 
  * too short (less than 5 characters long)
  * long enough (bigger or equal than 5 characters long)
* Outputs squares with each character of the inputted string
* When clicking on a square, it deletes such square and removes the corresponding character from the input value string
